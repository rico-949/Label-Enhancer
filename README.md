## How to add the plugin to GeoFS

DISCLAIMER: In order to use this plugin, you need to have the TamperMonkey extension installed on your browser which can be found here: https://www.tampermonkey.net/

Once you have TamperMonkey installed, its icon should show up on the right of your browser's search bar. Click it and click on "Add new script". 
Once the script creation window is open, copy the code in "plugin.js", paste it into the window and hit Ctrl + S to save it. The next time you open GeoFS, the plugin should be working just fine!
